# House refurbishment prototype VR

## Project idea
This house refurbishment prototype takes the fun mechanics from House Flipper and puts them in a VR setting, making it an interior designer simulator. You start with a messy room, where you pick up and dispose of trash, paint the walls, and clean the floor to transform the space into its best version.

## Core features
- Wall painting
- Picking up and throwing trash
